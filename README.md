# MEGA ATACseq

This is the GitHub page for the MEGA ATACseq Workflow, developed at the [Wellcome Centre for Human Genentics](https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/) in [Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/). It is an automated analysis workflow for the following datasets.
- B cells
- CD4 Cells 
It also includes two workflows for the following external datasets:
- Pritchard (Stanford University) dataset: [Landscape of stimulation-responsive chromatin across diverse human immune cells](https://doi.org/10.1101/409722)
- RamosRodriguez (Endocrine Regulatory Genomics Laboratory, Germans Trias i Pujol University Hospital and Research Institute, Badalona, Spain) dataset: [The impact of proinflammatory cytokines on the Î²-cell regulatory landscape provides insights into the genetics of type 1 diabetes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0524-6)

## Snakemake

The different workflows have been implemented with [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). There is a directory for each one of the datasets with a _snakefile_ that describes the workflow.

The _snakefiles_ will allow to run the workflows in a variety of computing environments. In our case, it is a SGE cluster. Most probably you will have to make a few modifications to the some of the scripts. Please read the documentation above for more information.

## Conda

In order to ensure reproducibility, we have used [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). You need to have conda installed somewhere in your PATH. The software packages and its versions are specified as part of the workflow and _Snakemake_ will download them and create the conda environments for you. You will need a working internet connection on the node you are submitting your jobs.
